- Hi, Iâ€™m @Joseph-Willem-Ricci
- Iâ€™m interested tools that enable a deeper resonance with the world.
- I'm currently working as a web developer / analyst at Duke University. In 2022, I graduated with a Master in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania, where I am still TA'ing [a class in Artificial Intelligence](https://artificial-intelligence-class.org/). Prior to that, I was a bicycle courier, bartender, musician, caregiver, and project manager at an indie record label. Prior to that, I studied mechanical, aerospace, and wind energy engineering at the University of Rochester, TU Delft and Danmarks Tekniske Universitet.
